✅ **Usage:**

* Use `⬜` for pending tasks.
* Replace `⬜` with `✅` when a task is completed.
* Can easily copy this table into **Notion, Obsidian, Markdown, or Excel** for live tickable tracking.

If you want, I can also **convert this into a fully interactive Markdown checklist** where each task has its own `[ ]` checkbox ready to tick digitally.
